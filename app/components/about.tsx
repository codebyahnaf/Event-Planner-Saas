                    <p>"I grew up in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, where block parties and family gatherings were everything. But whenever I tried to plan an event myself, it was a messâ€”venues double-booked, guest lists scattered, budgets blown, and endless group texts that never kept anyone on the same page. The breaking point was missing my cousinâ€™s birthday because of a scheduling mix-up. Thatâ€™s when it hit me: there had to be a better way. So I built one. An all-in-one event planner with a smart scheduler, budget tracker, easy invites, and live analyticsâ€”everything I once wished I had. What started as my struggle became a tool to help anyone plan with ease."</p>
